2. **Highly Customizable:** Tailor the framework to your design system through a configuration file.
3. **Responsive Design:** Built-in responsive modifiers make it easy to build responsive interfaces.
4. **Dark Mode:** Simple toggle for dark mode designs.
5. **Performance Optimized:** Unused styles are purged in production, resulting in minimal CSS.

## The Advantages of Tailwind CSS

>
  <div class="flex-shrink-0">
    <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
    <p class="text-gray-500">You have a new message!</p>

</div>
```
